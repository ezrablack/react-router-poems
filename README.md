### Deliverables
Complete these solo (feel free to reach out to others for help, but this should not be a full-on group activity like the discussion above)

To complete these deliverables, you will need to install React Router by running `  ` 

> Use the React Router lecture (linked in learn.co) and React Router's documentation (https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) as a guide to add routing to tie these pages together.

> You will need to define `Route`'s in App, and then use `useParams` and `history.push` where applicable to connect each of the App's components to those `Route`s.

#### PoemIndex
DONE * When a user clicks on "Create New Poem", they should be redirected to the PoemNew component
DONE* When a user clicks on the "See Details" button of a specific poem, they should be routed to the PoemShow component, which should show the details for the specific poem clicked
> Hint: you will need to use a param in the route to accomplish this

#### PoemNew
DONE* After the fetch request to make a new poem, the user should be redirected to the PoemIndex component

#### PoemShow
DONE* When a user clicks on the "Edit" button, they should be routed to the PoemEdit component, which should allow the user to edit the specific poem clicked
> Hint: you will need to use a param in the route to accomplish this
DONE* After the fetch request to delete the poem, the user should be redirected to the PoemIndex component


#### PoemEdit
* After the fetch request to update the poem, the user should be redirected to the PoemShow component, which should show the details for the specific poem clicked
